        "CRITICAL RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS:",
        "1. OUTPUT DIMENSIONS: Generate the output image at EXACTLY the same dimensions as the input bathroom image to ensure perfect before/after alignment",
        "2. Maintain the exact lighting, color temperature, and ambiance of the original bathroom",
        "3. Preserve all architectural details, tile work, fixtures, and decor",
        "4. DOOR REPLACEMENT & FULL-WIDTH COVERAGE (CRITICAL):",
        "   - FIRST: Identify the COMPLETE WIDTH of the shower entrance (wall-to-wall measurement)",
        "   - IGNORE any existing partial door, curtain rod, or walk-in opening in the original image",
        "   - If the original has a walk-in opening (no door), you MUST ADD a FULL-WIDTH door system",
        "   - If the original has a partial door or curtain, you MUST REPLACE it with a FULL-WIDTH door system",
        "   - The new door installation MUST span 100% of the shower entrance width from wall edge to wall edge",
        "   - DO NOT replicate the width of any existing door/opening - ALWAYS install wall-to-wall coverage",
        "   - Think of this as a brand new professional installation where the door MUST seal the entire entrance",
        "   - For walk-in showers: The door should cover the entire open area, not just match where a curtain rod might be",
        "5. DOOR SIZING VERIFICATION:",
        "   - Verify the door width matches the FULL shower entrance opening (not any existing partial door)",
        "   - For HINGED/PIVOT: Single panel must be wide enough to fully close the entrance",
        "   - For SLIDING: Combined panel width must cover wall-to-wall when closed",
        "   - The door system should look proportional and professional for the full entrance width",
        "6. DOOR POSITIONING (CRITICAL):",
        "   - SLIDING DOORS: Always show FULLY CLOSED with both panels visible meeting in the middle",
        "   - HINGED DOORS: Show SLIGHTLY OPEN (15-20 degrees) swinging outward away from shower",
        "   - PIVOT DOORS: Show SLIGHTLY OPEN (15-20 degrees) with the distinctive pivot swing pattern",
        "7. HANDLE PLACEMENT (CRITICAL):",
        "   - SLIDING DOORS: Handles on outer edges of panels only, NEVER at the center seam where panels meet",
        "   - HINGED DOORS: Hinges on ONE side only (left OR right edge), handle on the OPPOSITE side from hinges - this is standard door construction",
        "   - PIVOT DOORS: Pivot mechanism on ONE side only (left OR right, 4-6 inches from edge), handle on the OPPOSITE side from pivot - allows natural door operation",
        "8. GLASS TYPE (CRITICAL - MUST MATCH SPECIFICATION):",
        "   - The glass style applies to ALL glass panels in the enclosure - both the door AND any fixed panels",
        "   - Every piece of glass in the shower enclosure must use the same glass type consistently",
        "   - The glass MUST display the exact characteristics described in the GLASS STYLE VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS section above",
        "   - For CLEAR GLASS: Show smooth, transparent glass with subtle blue-green tint at edges on ALL panels",
        "   - For LOW IRON: Show completely colorless, neutral glass with no tint on ALL panels",
        "   - For P516 RAIN GLASS: Show VISIBLE vertical rain-like texture pattern on ALL glass panels (door AND fixed panels) - this is NOT clear glass, it MUST show the distinctive vertical striations that obscure what's behind it while letting light through",
        "   - The glass type is a PRIMARY FEATURE the customer selected - it MUST be clearly visible and accurate on every glass surface",
        "9. Hardware (hinges, handles, tracks, pivots) must be precisely rendered in {{hardware_finish_name}}",
        "10. Handle style should be clearly visible as {{handle_style_name}}",
        "11. The installation must look professionally done and seamlessly integrated",
        "12. Only modify the shower enclosure - all other elements remain unchanged",
        "13. The result should be indistinguishable from a professional installation photograph",
        "14. FINAL CHECKS:",
        "    - Confirm output image dimensions match input dimensions exactly",
        "    - Confirm the door spans the COMPLETE width of the shower entrance, wall-to-wall",
        "    - Confirm the GLASS TYPE matches the specification (especially for textured P516 rain glass)",
        "    - For HINGED DOORS: Confirm hinges are on ONE side only and handle is on the OPPOSITE side",
        "    - For PIVOT DOORS: Confirm pivot mechanism is on ONE side only and handle is on the OPPOSITE side",
        "",
