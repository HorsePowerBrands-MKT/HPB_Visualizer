        "3. DOOR INSTALLATION APPROACH:",
        "   - Treat every request as installing a completely new door system",
        "   - Ignore any existing door configuration in the original image",
        "   - New doors must span the FULL WIDTH of the shower entrance",
        "   - Converting a walk-in to a door system requires full coverage from edge to edge",
        "4. The shower glass must look crystal clear and premium quality",
        "5. Hardware (handles, hinges, tracks) must be accurately rendered in the specified finish",
        "6. The result should be indistinguishable from a real installation photo",
        "7. Maintain all architectural details of the original bathroom",
        "8. Only modify the shower enclosure area - everything else stays the same"
